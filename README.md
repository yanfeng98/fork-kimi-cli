[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli)

[中文](https://www.kimi.com/coding/docs/kimi-cli.html)

Kimi CLI is a new CLI agent that can help you with your software development tasks and terminal operations.

## Key features

- Shell-like UI and shell command execution
- IDE integration via [Agent Client Protocol]
- Zsh integration
- MCP support
- And more to come...

[Agent Client Protocol]: https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol

## Installation

Kimi CLI is published as a Python package on PyPI. We highly recommend installing it with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). If you have not installed uv yet, please follow the instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to install it first.

Once uv is installed, you can install Kimi CLI with:

```sh
uv tool install --python 3.14 kimi-cli
```

Run `kimi --help` to check if Kimi CLI is installed successfully.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to the security checks on macOS, the first time you run `kimi` command may take 10 seconds or more depending on your system environment.

## Upgrading

Upgrade Kimi CLI to the latest version with:

```sh
uv tool upgrade kimi-cli --no-cache
```

## Usage

Run `kimi` command in the directory you want to work on, then send `/setup` to setup Kimi CLI:

After setup, Kimi CLI will be ready to use. You can send `/help` to get more information.

## Features

### Shell command mode

Kimi CLI is not only a coding agent, but also a shell. You can switch the shell command mode by pressing `Ctrl-X`. In this mode, you can directly run shell commands without leaving Kimi CLI.

> [!NOTE]
> Built-in shell commands like `cd` are not supported yet.

### IDE integration via ACP

Kimi CLI supports [Agent Client Protocol] out of the box. You can use it together with any ACP-compatible editor or IDE.

To use Kimi CLI with ACP clients, make sure to run Kimi CLI in the terminal and send `/setup` to complete the setup first. Then, you can configure your ACP client to start Kimi CLI as an ACP agent server with command `kimi --acp` (or `kimi --acp --thinking` with thinking mode enabled).

For example, to use Kimi CLI with [Zed](https://zed.dev/) or [JetBrains](https://blog.jetbrains.com/ai/2025/12/bring-your-own-ai-agent-to-jetbrains-ides/), add the following configuration to your `~/.config/zed/settings.json` or `~/.jetbrains/acp.json` file:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Kimi CLI": {
      "command": "kimi",
      "args": ["--acp", "--thinking"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Then you can create Kimi CLI threads in IDE's agent panel.

### Zsh integration

You can use Kimi CLI together with Zsh, to empower your shell experience with AI agent capabilities.

Install the [zsh-kimi-cli](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/zsh-kimi-cli) plugin via:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MoonshotAI/zsh-kimi-cli.git \
  ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/kimi-cli
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using a plugin manager other than Oh My Zsh, you may need to refer to the plugin's README for installation instructions.

Then add `kimi-cli` to your Zsh plugin list in `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
plugins=(... kimi-cli)
```

After restarting Zsh, you can switch to agent mode by pressing `Ctrl-X`.

### Using MCP tools

Kimi CLI supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools.

**`kimi mcp` sub-command group**

You can manage MCP servers with `kimi mcp` sub-command group. For example:

```sh
# Add streamable HTTP server:
kimi mcp add --transport http context7 https://mcp.context7.com/mcp --header "CONTEXT7_API_KEY: ctx7sk-your-key"

# Add streamable HTTP server with OAuth authorization:
kimi mcp add --transport http --auth oauth linear https://mcp.linear.app/mcp

# Add stdio server:
kimi mcp add --transport stdio chrome-devtools -- npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest

# List added MCP servers:
kimi mcp list

# Remove an MCP server:
kimi mcp remove chrome-devtools

# Authorize an MCP server:
kimi mcp auth linear
```

**Ad-hoc MCP configuration**

Kimi CLI also supports ad-hoc MCP server configuration via CLI option.

Given an MCP config file in the well-known MCP config format like the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "CONTEXT7_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    },
    "chrome-devtools": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "chrome-devtools-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

Run `kimi` with `--mcp-config-file` option to connect to the specified MCP servers:

```sh
kimi --mcp-config-file /path/to/mcp.json
```

## Development

To develop Kimi CLI, run:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:yanfeng98/fork-kimi-cli.git
cd fork-kimi-cli

make prepare
```

Then you can start working on Kimi CLI.

Refer to the following commands after you make changes:

```sh
uv run kimi  # run Kimi CLI

make format  # format code
make check  # run linting and type checking
make test  # run tests
make test-kimi-cli  # run Kimi CLI tests only
make test-kosong  # run kosong tests only
make test-pykaos  # run pykaos tests only
make build  # build python packages
make build-bin  # build standalone binary
make help  # show all make targets
```

## Prek hooks

We use [prek](https://github.com/j178/prek) to run formatting and checks via git hooks.

Recommended setup:
1. Run `make prepare` to sync dependencies and install the prek hooks.
2. Optionally run on all files before sending a PR: `prek run --all-files`.

Manual setup (if you do not want to use `make prepare`):
1. Install prek: `uv tool install prek`.
2. Install the hooks in this repo: `prek install`.

After installation, the hooks run on every commit. The repo uses prek workspace mode, so only the
projects with changed files run their hooks. You can skip them for an intermediate commit with
`git commit --no-verify`, or run them manually with `prek run --all-files`.

The hooks execute the relevant `make format-*` and `make check-*` targets, so ensure dependencies
are installed (`make prepare` or `uv sync`).
